**Awesome DFIR Script**

This script aims to check the following:
```
- Recently logged in users
- Recent network connections 
- Collects processes for all users
- Collects recently deleted items
- Collects all contents of all user download folders, and collects a SHA256 hash
- Collects basic system information
- Collects key event IDs (4719, 4964, 4720, 4728 - at this stage)
- Collects recent removable drives
```

..and spits it out to multiple CSV documents for easy viewing.
